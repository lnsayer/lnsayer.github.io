# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Louis Sayer
## I am a physics graduate and aspiring data scientist. I am really interested in how AI can understand and contribute to science, particularly biology. 

I graduated from Durham University with an integrated master's degree in physics. This is when I was first exposed to machine learning as my master's project was on using a deep convolutional neural network to predict and understand protein transition states. I have developed a keen interest in this area ever since!

I also used my coding skills for modelling, analysis and visualisation in many other projects at Durham which I am proud of: 

âš› <a href="/files/Computing_project.pdf" target="_blank">Solving for the Helium Atom Energies with the Variational Method</a> I used numerical computational techniques to solve for the ground state energy and excited state energies of the helium atom.

â˜¢ <a href="/files/high_energy_beta_spectroscopy.pdf" target="_blank"> Determining the Spectral Energy Distributions and Absorption Coefficients for Sr-90 and Y-90</a> I detemined the combined energy spectra of two radioactive isotopes with a silicon surface barrier detector.

ðŸ”­ <a href="/files/betelgeuse_own.pdf" target="_blank">Measuring the dimming of Betelgeuse from Durham</a> I modelled the dimming of Betelgeuse in 2020 using my own telescope measurements and the astronomy community's measurements.

 ðŸ§² <a href="/files/Biot Savart Lab report Summative.pdf" target="_blank">Determination of the Permeability of Free Space using the Biot-Savart Law</a> I determined the permeability of free space, which relates the current passed through a conductor to its resulting magnetic field.

ðŸ’§<a href="/files/Water Viscosity Report 2.pdf" target="_blank">Determining the dynamic viscosity of water using the Poiseuille Equation</a> I determined the viscosity of water by measuring the flow rate of water from a capillary tube. 

Also here is my CV for those interested <a href="/files/alta_cv_3.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a>
